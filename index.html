            <p>Here are some helpful tips for managing emergencies and on-field injuries.
                <ol>
                    <li>Be confident! You are trained in this and know exactly what to do.</li>
                    <li>Call for help if you need it. There is no harm or charge for calling EMS.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use your medical terminology with the dispacher to communicate when you need Medic One so they do not send the wrong vehicle.</li>
                            <li>The patient/athlete will not be charged for calling EMS unless they get into the ambulance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Demand help if you need it! You cannot spineboard alone. Communicate sternly and with eye contact to communicate exactly what you need to happen.</li>
                    <li>Bring your emergency equipment...everywhere. Yes it is more to carry but you do not want to be caught unprepared.</li>
                    <li>Listen to your gut - when in doubt, sit them out (even if they beg you otherwise, hide that helmet where they can't get to it)!</li>
                    <li>Gauze and gloves are your best friends.</li>
                    <li>Remember that even if you are documenting an injury on your cellphone or tablet in a public setting, the crowd will assume you're texting and not paying attention.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Injury Evaluation</h2>
            <img src="./image_1.png" alt="no image yet" height="200" width="200">
            <p>The most important part to evaluating an injury is obtaining a medical history. This is 90% of your diagnosis!</p>

            <h2>Injury Treatment and Rehabilitation</h2>
            <img src="./image_1.png" alt="no image yet" height="200" width="200">
            <p>Educating and ensuring your athlete understands the cause of their pain will go a long way with their compliance with both your rehabilitation program and your particpation guidelines.</p>

            <h2>Injury Prevention and Strength Training</h2>
            <img src="./image_1.png" alt="no image yet" height="200" width="200">
            <p>Coaches and administration need to be your best friend for this! Work with your coaches to establish pre-season, post-season and off-season training expectations. Meet with your coaches and ensure their understanding of overuse injuries. Let them know you will be tracking and documenting patterns - if something becomes obvious, you expect them to modify practice format to add ankle prevention exercises or eliminate that really not needed and overused training drill that causing injuries.</p>

            <h2>Athletic Training Room Tips</h2>
            <img src="./image_1.png" alt="no image yet" height="200" width="200">
            <p>Time management is extremely important. Obviously we wish we could help every athlete with every little concern, but there's no time for that! Utilize handouts or write rehabilitation programs on a whiteboard. Walk an athlete or group of athletes through it once, and then set the expectation that they do it on their own for future sessions. You can tape ankles and oversee paired rehabilitation at the same time! You can't, however, expect yourself to individualize every last program specifically to the athlete and season of competition and that's okay. In your down time (LOL) create or rephrase the rehabilitation program you wrote for that UCL sprain to be generic elbow pain and a thrower and print extra copies.</p>

            <p>Hi! My name is Haley. I am on day three of a web development course through the University of Washington. I previously worked as an Athletic Trainer at a high school and in a sports medicine physician practice. This page is intended to help new Athletic Trainers establish their career with some helpful tips and tricks that I learned along the way. I am quickly typing these paragraphs and please excuse any typos or errors. Enjoy!</p>
